                <h3>Detection of APS failures in Scania trucks</h3>
                <p>Given is the <em><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/APS+Failure+at+Scania+Trucks">APS
                            Failure</a></em> at Scania Trucks data set from the <em>UCI Machine Learning
                        Repository</em>. The data set is from real world operational data of Scania trucks. The
                    classification is binary (pos and neg) denoted by the label. You've got 171 unnamed
                    features, where some are part of a histogram. In total, there 60.000 training examples and
                    16.000 test examples. Your task is to find a suitable method (or several) to automatically
                    recognize the label on the provided test data. It is up to you to analyse the data set, clean
                    and prepare it for the task. Please also note the cost of wrongly classified instances in the
                    description. Make use of that when evaluating your classifier. There are several general
                    steps, that you may need to take in order to achieve your goal:
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyse the data set and the attributes.</li>
                    <li>Clean the data, e.g. getting rid of missing values or outliers. (This could also be
                        done after creating the concept.)</li>
                    <li>Create a concept on how you can classify the data. Note down the differences
                        between the online and offline variant.</li>
                    <li>You may need to convert the data into a format useable for that concept.</li>
                    <li>Use (different, at least 2) suitable machine learning algorithms. You may take
                        existing libraries for that. (Hint: Please choose algorithms, that are not extremely
                        similar. For example, using only Decision Trees and Random Forests would be a
                        bad choice.)</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the results of your model/concept. Don't just write down raw numbers,
                        but also think about why it either does work or it doesn't.</li>
                    <li>Compare the results to different algorithms.</li>
                    <li>Present an outlook for improvements on your concept.</li>
                </ul>
                Please document every step that has been made in order to achieve the goal. If you
                use any libraries in your programming, reference where you've got them and which version
                your program uses. At best include the libraries in your contribution if possible. If you
                are using tools, please provide a link to the used tools and explain, what features have
                been used. It is not enough to just use the existing algorithms. You need to have an
                understanding, what exactly happens to the data. Therefore you should be able to explain
                (and also document!), why certain methods could or could not be used for your problem.</p>
